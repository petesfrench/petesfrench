### Hi ðŸ‘‹ With a passion for problem solving and people, I am looking for the next challange with a great team!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an personal project app to help people maintain their mental health in day-to-day life

ðŸŒ± I'm learning about some new back-end frameworks

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects bigger than myself, with the aim to help those who most need it

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a team that can guide and support me through my development as a programmer
