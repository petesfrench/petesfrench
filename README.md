### Hi ðŸ‘‹ With a passion for problem solving and people, I am looking for the next challange with a great team!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an personal project app to help people maintain their mental health in day-to-day life

ðŸŒ± I'm learning about some new back-end frameworks

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects bigger than myself, with the aim to help those who most need it

ðŸ’¬ Favorite quote: "Don't just do something! Sit there!"


My current passions out of programming:

- to keep growing professionally and personally 
- juggling 5 balls
- live a peaceful life
